This is Bruna`s first git project called Google-homepage!


Fist I wanna say about important git's commands that I've been learning so far, here is the webpage from theodinproject that I considered important to take a look.

In some steps:

1) to clone files from your guthub to your machine: git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git (this should be the SSH).

2) You can add new files in your folder as well as make some changes, than if you wanna update your files in your github as well you have to follow the next steps:
	a)type 'git status' to see all the documents status, this will give you information about them so you can know what you wanna do with them. The red one means your files is not at the stade area yet; the green one means you alredy transfered it at the stade area;
3) Type 'git add name-file' to transfer for the stade area;
4) Type git commit -m "name-file" and then type git status once more. The output should now say, “nothing to commit”, indicating that your changes have been committed;
5) Type 'git log' and look at the output. You will also see details on the author who made the commit and the date and time for when the commit was made.

Now your files are updated in your github!
